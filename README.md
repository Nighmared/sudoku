# Sudoku Generator and Solver

Wanted to write a sudoku generator, noticed this could also solve it, now it does both :)
Supports loading and dumping sudokus in the format specified in `tests/base.txt`
But nothing besides the Generating is available as CLI yet

## Usage

`python main.py [n]`
Where n is the number of fields to be empty/deleted. If no n is specified, n=45 will be used.
